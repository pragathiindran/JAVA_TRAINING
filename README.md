# DAY1 ASSIGNMAENT
Assignment 1

Implement the body for the following function:

static boolean isValidDate(int year, int month, int day) {
	// do stuff here
	return false;
}
The function should check if the parameter values constitute a valid calendar date or not. Accordingly return true or false.
Write a Java program to call the above function multiple times with different values.

Assignment 2

Implement the body for the following function:

static boolean isPrimeNumber(int num) {
	// do stuff here
	return false;
}
The function should check and return true only if the number passed as argument is a prime number.

Write a Java program to call the above function multiple times with different values.

Assignment 3

Write a function called "sortThreeNumbers", which takes 3 distinct integers and prints them in ascending order.

public void sortThreeNumbers(int a, int b, int c) {
	// do stuff here
}

Write a Java program to call the above function multiple times with different values.

Assignment 4

Write a function called "sumOfPrimes", that takes two integers as input and returns the sum of all the prime numbers between the same.

public int sumOfPrimes(int from, int to) {
	// do stuff here
	return 0;
}
Write a Java program to call the above function multiple times with different values.

Assignment 5

Write a function called "fibonacci", that takes index as paramter and returns the fibonacci number at that index.

public int fibonacci(int index) {
	// do stuff here
	return 0;
}

Assignment 6

Write a Java program to print the following pattern:

*
**
***
****
*****
The number of rows should be based on the value of a variable "num", and the number of stars in a row is based on the row number itself.

Assignment 7

Write a Java function that accepts angle in degrees and returns the sine of the given angle.

Call the function in main, multiple times by supplying multiple values and verify the same.

PS:

Divide the function into small reusable functions, if possible.
Do not use builtin Java classes like Math

Assignment 8

Implement the Java function listed below:

public static void printCalendar(int month, int year) {
	/// do stuff here
}
The function should accept month and year and print the calendar for the same. If inputs are invalid, appropriate error message/s should be printed.

Sample output for the inputs (8, 2018):

Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa
          1  2  3  4
 5  6  7  8  9 10 11
12 13 14 15 16 17 18
19 20 21 22 23 24 25
26 27 28 29 30 31
PS:

Do not use any builtin Java classes like Date or Calendar
Divide the function into small reusable functions, if possible.

Assignment 9

Write a function called "sumOfEvensAndOdds", that takes an array of integers as input and returns another array of integers of length 2. The first element in the returned array is the sum of all even numbers in the input array, and the second element in the returned array is the sum of all odd numbers in the input array.

public int[] sumOfEvensAndOdds(int []nums) {
	// do stuff here
	return null;
}

Call the function in main, multiple times by supplying multiple values and verify the same.

Assignment 10

Write a function called "reverseByWords", that takes a sentence (string) as an input, and returns another string. The return value must be a sentence in which the words in the original sentence appear in reverse order.

public String reverseByWords(String sentence) {
	// do stuff here
	return null;
}

Call the function in main, multiple times by supplying multiple values and verify the same.

Assignment 11

Write a function called "inWords" that takes a number between 1 and 99,99,99,999 and returns a String representing the input number in words.

public String inWords(int num) {
	// do stuff here
	return null;
}

Call the function in main, multiple times by supplying multiple values and verify the same.
